# Coding Lab 7: Monitoring Elderly Patientâ€™s Movement in Bed Using Motion
# Detection
# Situation Story:
# You are working on a healthcare project to monitor elderly patients who are bedridden. The goal
# is to detect any unusual movements (e.g., if the patient is trying to get out of bed or moving
# excessively), which could indicate discomfort or a potential fall. Your task is to create a program
# that captures video and detects any significant motion. If motion is detected, it will highlight the
# movement.
# Task:
# 1. Capture a video feed from the webcam.
# 2. Implement motion detection by comparing the current frame with the previous frame.
# 3. If significant movement is detected, highlight the area of motion.
# 4. Display both the original frame and a motion-highlighted frame side by side.
